Identifying features

This mini project on  **Calendar in C**  programming language is a console application without graphics. To make the calendar look colorful, many windows properties have been used in this project. Besides the color used in backgrounds, the days of the month are white and the vacations (Sundays) are indicated using the red foreground color.

In this mini project, you can find out the day corresponding to a given date and view the days and dates corresponding to a particular month+year. To help you understand the calendar mini project better, there are lots of comments within the source code. This project is aimed to teach you &quot;how to make Calendar using C&quot;.

State of art/Research

Basically three operations can be done in this calendar application. To find out the day corresponding to a given date, the date, month and year are asked. You can list the days and dates of any month of any year. For example, entering 04 2014 (April 2014) will give you an output as shown in the screenshot in this post.

You can navigate the months using arrow keys, or press &#39;n&#39; and &#39;p&#39; keys to view the next and previous months respectively. The third feature of this C mini project on Calendar application utilizes file handling. With this feature, you can add important notes with corresponding dates.
